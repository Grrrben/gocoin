After building the app it will run on port 8000 unless a -p flag is set.

[localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Flags

`-name` The name of your client. Optional.  
  
`-p` Port number on which the client will run. If omitted, the client will run on port `8000`.  
Usage: `-p=8001`

## API calls

Postman [collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ca46387e102621040d2c) of the call's.

### Transactions

[POST] `http://localhost:8000/transaction`

Add a new transaction:
```
{
 "sender": "fad5e7a92f1c43b1523614336a07f98b894bb80fee06b6763b50ab03b597d5f4",
 "recipient": "fad5e7a92f1c43b1523614336a07f98b894bb80fee06b6763b50ab03b597d5f4",
 "message": "An optional message",
 "amount": 5
}
```

The transaction must have valid hashes for sender and recipient otherwise a 422 is returned with a error message.  

`Invalid Transaction (Unable to decode)`  
`Invalid Transaction (Sender invalid)`  
`Invalid Transaction (Recipient invalid)`  
`Invalid Transaction (Insufficient Credit)`

If the transaction is added the client will distribute the transaction throughout the network.

[GET] `http://localhost:8000/resolve`

Resolve conflicts in the chain.
The client checks the list of other nodes in the network and replaces it's blockchain if a larger one is found.
Responses with true if the chain is replaced, otherwise false.

### Network

[GET] `http://localhost:8000/client` Get a list of clients

The response exists of a `length`, representing the total number oof clients, and a `list` of all clients.

```
{
    "length": 3,

    ]
}
```

[POST] `http://localhost:8000/client` Add a client to the network

The POSTed data should be consistent with a Client.

 "ip": "123.456.78.90", // string
 "protocol": "http://", // string
 "port": 8080, // int
 "name": "This is me" // string
}
```

If successful, the client is added and the response will consist of the client and a total of clients in the network.
`{"Client":{"hostname":"localhost","protocol":"http://","port":8003,"name":"Name of the client","hash":"f1c13a0c8292fa5c9dfe565a19f79c2993619e9b6c5da0669b5c886043224673"},"total":3}`

The HTTP code is a 200 on success or a 409 if a conflict with curretn listed clients arises.
